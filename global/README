Scripts in this folder take the global 1980 daily deviation and monthly data 
provided by Gianluca and Gunther and produce the daily input files for pyaez.
Scripts should be run in the following order and descriptions follow:


00_pxv_to_dat.f95
Inputs: pxv files containing daily deviations
Outputs: dat files containing daily deviations
Decription: Translate daily deviations from pxv to dat. These files contain 
only grid cells with data present (cells under the mask are not present).

01_dat_to_nc.ipynb
Inputs: dat files containing daily deviations
Outputs: netcdf files containing daily deviations on a global grid
Description: Translate daily deviation dat files to netcdf with appropriate
metadata attached. Also, put data onto a global grid (2160 latitudes x 4320 
longitudes) where cells without data/under the mask are assigned to nan.
Scale factors/unit conversions provided by Gunther are applied during the 
translation process.

02_rst_to_nc.ipynb
Inputs: rst files containing monthly data and elevation
Outputs: netcdf files of monthly data, admin mask, elevation on global grid
Description: Translate rst monthly files to netcdf on a global grid (2160 
latitudes x 4320 longitudes) with appropriate metadata attached. Generate a
0/1 administrative mask because the masks provided (ALOSmask_5m.rst) did not 
match each other or where either the monthly or daily deviation files had 
data present. The global mask generated has 2268708 grid cells equal to one,
representing land grid cells with data present. Also, translate elevation to
netcdf.

03_create_pyaez_daily.ipynb
Inputs: netcdf files containing daily devations and monthly data
Outputs: netcdf files containing daily data
Description: Generate daily data values by adding the daily deviation to the
monthly data. Create two new variables Wind-2m from Wind-10m and Rhum from
Vapr, Tmin-2m, Tmax-2m.
